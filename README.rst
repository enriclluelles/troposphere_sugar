Motivation
==========

Do you use Cloudformation templates to deploy, mantain and make sense of your infrastructure?

Do you use troposphere_ to enrich, automate and ease the creation of such templates?

troposphere_sugar is a tiny library that allows you to write troposphere templates in a bit more declarative manner while still retaining the power that makes troposphere an appealing alternative to writing JSON/YAML templates

Install
=======

Through pip::

    $ pip install troposphere_sugar


.. _troposphere: https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere
